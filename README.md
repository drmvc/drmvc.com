## What is DrMVC?

This project is created in order to incorporate all the best
practices in working with the MVC conception implemented on PHP.
Inspired by such remarkable projects as Simple-MVC, Phalcon,
Symphony, Kohana and Slim, and if you work with these
frameworks earlier, then you will not have much difficulty
understanding how everything is arranged here.
